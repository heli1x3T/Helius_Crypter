## 🔧 Features

- **Executable Encryption**: Encrypt .exe files with AES-256 and protect the encryption key with RSA-2048
- **PDF Exploit Generator**: Convert executables into PDF files with embedded payload
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted files using the provided keys
- **Runtime Protection**: Advanced anti-debugging and anti-VM techniques to protect your payloads
- **Signature Morphing**: Dynamic code transformation to create unique file signatures every time
- **Antivirus Bypass**: Advanced obfuscation techniques to bypass VirusTotal and other antivirus solutions
- **Modern UI**: Dark mode interface with neon accents for a cybersecurity feel

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The frontend only simulates encryption/decryption processes
- For a functional tool, you would need to implement the backend using Node.js or another server technology
- The cryptographic operations should be implemented with caution and following best practices

## 📚 Academic References

- This project is based on research into signature-based detection methods used by modern antivirus solutions
- The PDF exploit technique demonstrates vulnerabilities documented in various academic papers
